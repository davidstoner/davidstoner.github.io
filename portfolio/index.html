        <h2>Conversations</h2>
        <p>The Conversations application enables businesses to text message with their customers one-on-one through an online interface.</p>
        <p>It combines many design aspects of UI users are familiar with such as email, support systems, and text messaging applications to bring ingrained comfort to a new system letting new users hit the ground running.</p>
        <p>Many of the features enhance productivity without increasing complexity by presenting intuitive interfaces for complex solutions. Filters, prewritten messages, autoreplies, and keywords are all powerful tools made simple by thoughtful design.</p>
        <p>Its responsive design translates these features to a form factor that works seamlessly on a phone or tablet.</p>

        <h2>Best Worst Answer Mobile Game</h2>
        <p>This is a personal project that brings a clever card game online.</p>
        <p>The user experience was pared down as much as possible to make getting into a game as easy as can be. Simply put in your name, the room you want to join, and you're ready to play. Once in a game, it leverages a card based design language familiar to anyone who's played a party game with friends. Free form rules make each game unique but the process is gently guided by the system to make sure everyone understands what's happening during each round.</p>
        <p>In comparison to a practical card game, this online version excels in unexpected ways that enhance the user experience. There's no need for supplies. Pen and paper is not required. The "cards" are all built into the application. And the biggest advantage is that because it uses the phone for play it prevents distraction from all the other things your phone has access to.</p>

        <h2>Aerialink</h2>
        <p>This overhaul of the Aerialink company website helped present a fresh face to potential customers.</p>
        <p>Information was at the core of the new design. We spent many months writing new content to better inform users of an intricate ecosystem that very few of familiar with. Along with that new cache of knowledge was a need to make it easy to access. A simple hierarchy of pages helps facilitate that discovery while large, straight-forward typography let the designs breath and keep from overwhelming users.</p>
